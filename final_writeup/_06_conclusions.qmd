# Conclusions
This project developed a machine learning model to predict short-term stock price movement following a government contract award, with particular focus on how this response is modulated by earnings proximity, momentum, and contract characteristics. Using an XGBoost regression model and a Pseudo-Huber loss function, we trained the system to estimate the two-day percent change in stock price following a contract event.

The final model demonstrated a week predictive performance on out-of-sample data, achieving an R² of 0.21, MAE of 0.74, and RMSE of 1.64. These metrics indicate that the model did not capture a meaningful portion of short-term stock movement. However, with further tuning, the model still shows sign of promise.

    R²: 0.2156
    MAE: 0.7368
    RMSE: 1.6384
    Max Error: 21.39
    Median AE: 0.2646

## Ethical Considerations
All of our data was ultimately sourced from publicly available resources, allowing us to leverage existing infrastructure without ethical or legal concerns related to proprietary information. In working with this data, we aimed to include as much relevant information as possible without compromising accuracy or validity.

### Privacy
Our ultimate goal was to create a tool that a general audience could operate. For us, this meant needing to keep privacy at the forefront of our priorities. We upheld this priority by successfully obtaining our data from public sources. Because stock market data is inherently public and widely disseminated, we did not encounter any privacy concerns or require access to personally identifiable information, as would be the case if a personal API key were needed.

### Bias
#### Data Bias
When working with financial data, it is important to acknowledge the inherent volatility and sensitivity of markets to external events. Trends and disruptions may occur that cannot be fully explained by data alone. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock market experienced significant and unprecedented shifts that diverged from prior historical patterns. Analyzing data that spans such anomalous periods without accounting for those external factors may lead to misleading conclusions.

#### Selection Bias
Furthermore, our data is limited to companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. While these exchanges represent a significant portion of the U.S. stock market, they are not all encompassing of the United States market. Other exchanges—such as Miami International Holdings, the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), and Investors Exchange (IEX)—were not included in this analysis, which may limit the ability to generalize our findings. Future advancements of this project should include stock data from a more diverse selection of exchanges.

#### Outside Political Impact
Depending on the political party in power at any given time, government contracts could be distributed differently. This project did not make a specific effort to root out this bias, although we strongly recommend that the next iteration includes a flag indicating the political party in the White House and each chamber of Congress. It's not clear what kind of impact this could have, but it could help control for external influences of bias.

## Closing
Our goal was ambitious: to create a universally accessible tool capable of accurately predicting stock outcomes—a truly groundbreaking undertaking. While we didn’t fully achieve that vision, we’ve built a solid foundation. The next team will be able to hit the ground running, armed with our research, infrastructure, and clear next steps to breathe new life into the project.

Now more than ever, transparency at the intersection of government and financial markets is essential. Americans deserve a political system that serves the public good, not personal financial gain. It is imperative to take meaningful action to level the playing field for those without streamlined access to government contract information. We look forward to the day when this model operates effectively and efficiently, advancing both accountability and opportunity.
