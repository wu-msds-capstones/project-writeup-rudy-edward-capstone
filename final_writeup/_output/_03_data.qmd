# Data
## Sources
Our dataset is comprised of information from three sources, each requiring a unique blend of Extraction, Transformation, and Loading into our database.

![Data sources](./images/sources.png){#fig-data-sources width=60%}

### USA Spending
USA Spending (USASpending.gov) is operated by the United States federal government and posts details about federal contracts that have been awarded. Information presented here include: the award date, company's name, industrial sector, services contracted, and contract amount.

### Nasdaq
Nasdaq is one of the securities exchanges in the United States. Not every publicly-traded company is listed on the Nasdaq, however, Nasdaq does post information such as company name and ticker symbol for each company listed on the Nasdaq and other exchanges.

### Yahoo Finance (via yFinance)
Yahoo Finance is a highly-respected platform for viewing stock market data and related news. Independent contributors have created yFinance, a package available via the Python platform, along with others. Yahoo Finance and yFinance are not affiliated, rather the makers of yFinance extract data from Yahoo Finance's site and publish it for public use.

## Data Engineering - Extract, Transform, & Load (ETL)

Our ETL process was not linear. Before we could call our final stock data, we needed stock ticker data and contract award dates. This information would allow us to focus our API calls fro myFinance. Below is an overview at our ETL process.

### Extract
#### *USA Spending*
We downloaded a dataset directly from USASpending.gov (*"the government"*) after entering our desired criteria into the search fields. In an ideal scenario, we would have made use of the API that is provided, however, the timing of our data collection did not provide the conditions for this method.

#### *Nasdaq*
Nasdaq provides a text file with specific information related to companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Such information incldues: company symbol, security name, and market category. In addition, Nasdaq also provides this information for "other" companies which are not listed on the Nasdaq. This text file was read into a dataframe using the Pandas Python library via trivial read function such as `pandas.read_csv()`.

#### *Yahoo Finance*
Stock price data was called using Python and the yFinance API. We structured our API call such that only tickers which belonged to government contractors were called. We will discuss our method for distilling those tickers in the next section.

### Transform
#### Cleaning the data
Stock tickers from the Nasdaq were filtered using Python to ensure there were no duplicate companies and only common stocks were represented in the data. We will refer to this resulting dataset as `updated_tickers`.

As received, the data we downloaded from *the government* was all the same data type, which needed to be imported into Python using the proper types. In general, the data was complete, with virtually no missing or corrupted information. We subsetted this dataset to only include features which we would need, such as `action_date`, `recipient_name`, and `federal_action_obligation`. We will refer to this resulting dataset as `cleaned_gov_contracts`.


| **Column** | **Description** |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `action_date`| Contract award date |
| `recipient_name`| Company name |
| `federal_action_obligation`| Contract amount |


Company names ("recipient name") reflected the official SEC filings, which do not always match the names listed in the stock market. Another finding was the presence of multiple distinct tickers from the same company, which can occur for special types of securities - we will not cover those types in this analysis.

To resolve mismatches and consolidate multiple tickers, we used the rapidfuzz Python package, which provides high-performance "fuzzy" string matching, enabled us to match data from *the government* and the Nasdaq with high confidence.

#### Combining the Data
Using `tickers` and `contracts` we used key information like `ticker` and `action_date` to make API calls to yFinance and retrieve historical stock data. The `ticker` information was essential for us to be able to tell yFinance which stock we were interested in. We used `action_date` (date at which the contract was awarded) as a marker to then request yFinance for stock data near the next earnings call.

### Load
Once the transformation phase was complete, we loaded the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database hosted in the cloud via Railway—chosen for its ease of use, low cost, and reliable accessibility.

We wrote a Python script to define the schema, create tables, and establish relationships between data tables. Key Python packages used for this stage included **csv** and **psycopg2**, which facilitated seamless interaction with the PostgreSQL database using standard credentials and connection strings.

## Exploration
In political discourse, a recurring question is “where” and “why” Congressional spending occurs. To explore the “where,” we examined how federal contract dollars are distributed across U.S. government agencies.

Our initial analysis shows that the **Department of Defense** (DoD) receives the largest allocation of contract funding. Notably, the gap between the top two agencies—DoD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)—is approximately $961 billion, which is substantial. At the opposite end, the Department of Transportation and Department of Commerce receive the least funding.

Building on this, we investigated how DoD funding is distributed among private contractors. We observed that multiple subsidiaries of the same parent company appear among the top recipients of federal funds.

These findings highlight how federal tax dollars can appear to be clustered within a few corporate families, even though the entities receiving the contracts are technically distinct subsidiaries.

Another key finding was the trend in government funding allocation. This situation is particularly noteworthy given the recent change in presidential administration. While it is not immediately clear whether the surge in spending observed in February 2025 is directly related to the transition, it is certainly a development worth monitoring.
