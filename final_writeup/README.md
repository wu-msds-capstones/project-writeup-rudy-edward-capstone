# Quarto Starting Template for MSDS Capstone Writeup

The files provided within should provide a starting point for an organizational scheme and template for writing your capstone. Everything can be shifted or changed as needed or you see fit: this is just a starting point.

This template already has an orphaned gh-pages repo created, so all that is necessary for HTML publication is to activate it in the repo settings and then publish to it from the Quarto CLI.
